# Container Loading Optimization app
![](https://github.com/NienkePieters/container-app/blob/main/container_app_shorter_cropped.gif)

## About the app: 
- This app can help carriers optimise the load in their containers. It solves the two-dimensional knapsack problem (2D-KP) and has been built using Python and VIKTOR. 
- It is based on the following article: https://towardsdatascience.com/maximize-the-loading-capacity-of-a-sea-container-to-reduce-your-shipping-costs-with-python-8cc02c9725a7
- You can select the type of container and the type/quantity of pallets; the algorithm places them in the container to maximise the amount of pallets, increasing filling rate.

## To use the app: 
1. Install the VIKTOR cli - create a free account via https://www.viktor.ai/start-building-apps. Also see https://docs.viktor.ai/docs/getting-started/installation/
2. Clone the container-app repo
3. In your system terminal or IDE terminal;
  - Navigate to the container-app (click on the folder or "cd container-app")
  - Execute the install command, to install the app and its dependencies: "viktor-cli install"
  - After installation, start the app: "viktor-cli start"
4. Open the app in your browser by visiting (Ctrl+click) the URL shown in the command-line shell: cloud.viktor.ai
